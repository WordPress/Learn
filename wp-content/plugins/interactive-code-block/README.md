Enables running PHP code directly in the browser thanks to [WordPress Playground](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground).

**This is an early preview to gather feedback and apply polish. This plugin isn't yet a well-rounded and feature-complete solution.**

The Interactive Code Block provides a live, interactive PHP environment where you can write and execute PHP code snippets, see the results in real-time, and refine your understanding of WordPress development.

## Usage

-   Navigate to any post or page editing screen in WordPress.
-   Click the '+' button to add a new block and search for 'Interactive Code Block'.
-   Select the Interactive Code Block from the list of available blocks.
-   A new interactive code block will be inserted into your post or page. You can start typing PHP code directly into the block.
-   Click the 'Run' button to execute the code and see the results in the output area below the code block.

## Safety and Security

The Interactive Code Block Gutenberg Plugin executes PHP in the browser and never on the server. This is to prevent any unintended consequences or security risks from executing arbitrary PHP code.
